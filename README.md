# README - Secure Web App

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Install and Set-Up rails with the following guide:

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.1/getting_started.html

Open the application in your text editor (VSCode)

In the terminal run "bundle install" in order to make sure all GEMs install correctly

In the terminal run "rails s" in order to start an server instance locally from you machine

In your browser search for "localhost:3000" which will open the Web Application in your browser.
